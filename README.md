## Design

### Design Choices
The design of the website is tailored towards giving a sense of the atmosphere in the restaurant, a warm and cozy place but with a touch of class.
Sharp corners have been avoided to give a welcoming appearance.
Several Images and interactive elements have rounded corners on the inside and are purposefully cut of by the edge of the screen.

### Colour
The colour scheme was chosen to match the colours used in the restaurant.  
Contrast has been tested on WebAIM and colours have been adapted where necessary to ensure legibility.

<br>

### Fonts
Playfair-Display  with cursive as fallback was used for all text as to match the font used on the physical menu.

### Structure
The page uses a often used and easily recognized layout. 
A navigation bar is pinned to the top of every page providing easy navigation. At the bottom of the screen users wil find the footer providing a clear secondary link to the contact section (especially at lower resolutions where it removes the need to use the dropdown menu for customers who quickly want to book a table "on the go") and links to the restaurants social media acounts.

The website consists of five separate pages: 
- A homepage wich offers a view of the terras from one of the tables.
- An about page with the "About Us" tekst and an indoor shot of the restaurant.
- A menu page with its own side-bar for easy navigation to the different menu sections.
- A image gallery with images taken at the restaurant as well as general inspiring pictures of food and food preparation.
- A contact page with a contact/reservation form, a map and the resaurant's location and contact information.

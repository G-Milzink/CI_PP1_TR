## Design

### Design Choices
The design of the website is tailored towards giving a sense of the atmosphere in the restaurant, a warm and cozy place but with a touch of class.
Sharp corners have been avoided to give a welcoming appearance.

### Colour
The colour scheme was chosen to match the colours used in the restaurant.  
Contrast has been tested on WebAIM and colours have been adapted where necessary to ensure legibility.

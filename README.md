## Design

### Design Choices
The design of the website is tailored towards giving a sense of the atmosphere in the restaurant, a warm and cozy place but with a touch of class.
Sharp corners have been avoided to give a welcoming appearance.
Several Images and interactive elements have rounded corners on the inside and are purposefully cut of by the edge of the screen.

### Colour
The colour scheme was chosen to match the colours used in the restaurant.  
Contrast has been tested on WebAIM and colours have been adapted where necessary to ensure legibility.

### Fonts
Playfair-Display  with cursive as fallback was used for all text as to match the font used on the physical menu.
